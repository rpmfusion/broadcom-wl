## /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/90-broadcom-wl.conf file
##
##   Use only with Broadcom STA wireless driver provided by RPMFusion
##   broadcom-wl, akmod-wl and kmod-wl packages.
##
##   This file disables randomized MAC address while scanning wireless
##   access point with Broadcom STA wireless driver (wl) as a workaround
##   for RHBZ#1703745 and RFBZ#5245.
##   See also:
##   - https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777523
##   - RHBZ#1695696
##
##   Use with care as anonymity is potentially disabled while scanning
##   for a wireless access point.
